# DCGAN
This project focuses on generating cartoon-style facial images by implementing a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN), showcasing the potential of deep learning in creative and generative tasks

# What are GANs?
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one of the most interesting ideas in computer science today. Two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. A generator ("the artist") learns to create images that look real, while a discriminator ("the art critic") learns to tell real images apart from fakes.
